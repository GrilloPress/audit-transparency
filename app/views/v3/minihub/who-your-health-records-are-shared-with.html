            <h2>Health and care staff </h2>
            <p>
              Your full health records will only be seen by the health and care staff who are involved in your care.
            </p>
            <h2>Organisations </h2>
            <p>
              Some of the information from your health records can be used by organisations for different reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                NHS providers and commissioners - to plan where the NHS needs to improve or provide more health services
              </li>
              <li>
                Pharmacies – to make sure they have enough stock of medicine by looking at what illnesses people have in their area
              </li>
              <li>
                University researchers - to find cures and better treatments for illnesses
              </li>
              <li>
                Charities – to look at NHS services and find ways to improve care
              </li>
              <li>
                Software providers – to provide computer systems for the NHS to use and develop smartphone apps to help people manage illnesses
              </li>
              <li>
                Pharmaceutical companies – to develop new medicines
              </li>
              <li>
                Analytics services – to help the NHS analyse large amounts of health data
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What organisations cannot do with your health records</h2>
            <h3>Marketing and insurance </h3>
            <p>
              Your health records cannot be used by the NHS or other organisations for:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                marketing purposes
              </li>
              <li>
                insurance purposes
              </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Your health records can only be used for marketing and insurance purposes if you ask for them to be used in this way.
          </p>

          <h3>Sharing your health records with third parties</h3>
          <p>Organisations have to sign legal contracts before they can use your health records. </p>
          <p>The legal contract will state that health records cannot be given to any third parties, unless an independent review committee has approved it. </p>
          <h2>Choosing to opt out </h2>
          <p><a href="#">You can choose to opt out</a> of your confidential patient information being used for reasons other than your own individual care. </p>
