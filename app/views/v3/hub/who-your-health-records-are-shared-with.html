  <h2>Health and care staff</h2>
  <p>Health and care staff might look at your health records to care for you. For example they might look at your Summary Care Record to check if you have any allergies.</p>
  <h2>Companies</h2>
  <p>Some of the information from your health records can be used by companies such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>NHS providers and commissioners - to plan where the NHS needs to improve or provide more health services</li>
    <li>Pharmacies – to make sure they have enough stock of medicine by looking at what illnesses people have in their area</li>
    <li>University researchers - to find cures and better treatments for illnesses</li>
    <li>Charities – to look at NHS services and find ways to improve care</li>
    <li>Software providers – to provide computer systems and apps for the NHS to use</li>
    <li>Pharmaceutical companies – to develop new medicines</li>
    <li>Analytics services – to help the NHS analyse large amounts of health data</li>
