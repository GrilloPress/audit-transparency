            <h2>By removing information that identifies you </h2>
            <p>Your health records are anonymised as much as possible before theyâ€™re used by organisations.</p>
            <p>Anonymised means taking away information that identifies you such as your name and address. </p>
            <h2>By using an independent review committee</h2>
            <p>Before organisations can use your health records, they must be approved by an independent review committee to check:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>why they need your health records</li>
              <li>who will look at your health records</li>
              <li>how your health records will be kept secure</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If organisations are approved to use your health records they will only get the information they need to know.</p>
            <h2>By using strong IT security</h2>
            <p>Your health records must be stored securely and protected by passwords so only the appropriate people will be able to access it.</p>
